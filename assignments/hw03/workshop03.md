# Workshop #3

## Overview

During our workshops, you'll get a head start on doing homework by working as a group on one of the homework files. The first part of the class will be a short lecture... which is then followed by 50 minutes of group work. Once the group work is finished, we'll reconvene in the main room and discuss common issues.

You'll submit your group work (which can be a work-in-progress and not complete) at the end of the class. The completed work, along with the remainder of your homework should be uploaded to the NYU Classes by the due date.

⚠️ __Every group member must submit their own form, though the code may be the similar for `starry_starry_night.py`__
